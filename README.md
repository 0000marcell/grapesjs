Grapes is a free and open source WTE (Web Template Editor) for building HTML templates to be used inside sites, webapps, newsletters or anything else. 
Be aware that is not a 'Website Builder' but a tool to create HTML structure and containers for contents. The great thing about Grapes is that you 
can customize it, extend it or even integrate with other applications.
